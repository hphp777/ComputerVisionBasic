- Purpose of this code
 This code is for increasing image contrast and so that we can make intensities of input image distributed more even. 
 It is applied to R,G,B channel repectively. 
 Therefore, user of this code can understand equalizing intensities of R,G,B channel is inappropriate because R,G,B channel are dependent to each other.  

- How to run this code
 Through visual studio. Run hist_qe_RGB.cpp with 'input.jpg' image.

- How to adjust parameters (if any)
 void hist_eq_Color(Mat &input, Mat &equalized, G(*trans_func)[3], float **CDF);
 Mat &input: Give Mat variable which would be equalized(RGB image).
 Mat &equalized: Give Mat variable to save equalized image(RGB image).
 G(*trans_func)[3]: Give array of which size is 256(the number of levels of intensity). It is isnitialized with 0s. This contain trans_function for each R, G, B channel.
 float **CDF: Give double pointer which point to CDF of R, G, B 

- How to define default parameters
 void hist_eq_Color(Mat &input, Mat &equalized, G(*trans_func)[3], float **CDF);
 Mat &input: Give Mat variable which would be equalized(RGB image).
 Mat &equalized: Give Mat variable to save equalized image(RGB image).
 G(*trans_func)[3]: Give array of which size is 256(the number of levels of intensity). It is isnitialized with 0s. This contain trans_function for each R, G, B channel.
 float **CDF: Give double pointer which point to CDF of R, G, B
