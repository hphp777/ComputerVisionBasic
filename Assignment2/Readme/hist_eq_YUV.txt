- Purpose of this code
 This code is for increasing image contrast and so that we can make intensities of input image distributed more even. 
 To equalize image, this code convert color space from RGB to YUV.
 Than apply histogram equalization to Y channel and convert back to RGB color space. 

- How to run this code
 Through visual studio. Run hist_qe_RGB.cpp with 'input.jpg' image.

- How to adjust parameters (if any)
 void hist_eq(Mat &input, Mat &equalized, G *trans_func, float *CDF);
 Mat &input: Give Mat variable which would be equalized(RGB image).
 Mat &equalized: Give Mat variable to save equalized image(RGB image).
 G *trans_func: Give array of which size is 256(the number of levels of intensity). It is isnitialized with 0s. It is for Y.
 float *CDF: Give double pointer which point to CDF for Y.

- How to define default parameters
 void hist_eq(Mat &input, Mat &equalized, G *trans_func, float *CDF);
 Mat &input: Give Mat variable which would be equalized(RGB image).
 Mat &equalized: Give Mat variable to save equalized image(RGB image).
 G *trans_func: Give array of which size is 256(the number of levels of intensity). It is isnitialized with 0s. It is for Y.
 float *CDF: Give double pointer which point to CDF for Y.
